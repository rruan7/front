This portfolio is a fullstack application I built to showcase my personal projects and other things that I'm up to! 

# Portfolio Frontend

The frontend for my portfolio was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and components from the reactstrap and bootstrap libraries. The "projects" page is populated from the Django backend through REST API calls.

The routing for my app is located in the index.js file, and the navigation bar is stylized and rendered as a component in Router.js.
